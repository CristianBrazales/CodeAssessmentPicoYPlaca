# CodeAssessmentPicoYPlaca

Code assessment about pico y placa.
Rules:

Depending on the license plate number , a date , and a time. The program should return whether or not that car can be on the road. 
Input: 
Plate number : The unique letter-number combination consists of three letters followed by three or four digits ranging from 000 to 9999
Format accepted: 'AAA000'
Date: Date the car is on the road
Format accepted: 'YYYY/MM/DD'
Time: Hour the car is on the road
Format accepted: (24Hour) 'HH:MM'

To create flexibility and maiteniance, two classes were created (PicoYplaca and Vehicle)
#PicoYplaca

PicoYplaca sets the restrictions based on an input array that maps the last digit (index of the array) of a vehicle and the list of days this can not drive for example
example:
[[5,1], [2], [1],..]
[5,1] is the list at index 0, meaning that vehicles with the last digit 0 can not drive on days 5(Friday) and 1(Monday)
[2] is the list at index 1, meaning that vehicles with the last digit 2 can not drive on days 2 (Tuesday)
...
PicoYplaca sets the restrictions hours based on a list of periods where the pico y placa is active
example:
[[06:00 - 09:00],[17:00-19:00]]

By having the set of restrictions as input we can easily mantain the code and make it independent of certain values

For testing this are the restrictions:
PICO Y PLACA( RESTRICTIONS )

 *  Horario: 7:00 a 9:00 y de 16:00 a 19:30

#Vehicle 
This class validates the plates and other inputs and checks if the vehicle is allowed to drive
